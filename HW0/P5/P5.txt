Problem 1

If the cashier first added the totals of individuals pairwise, they could make 128 additions of the totals of two bags.  
They could then make 64 additions of the totals of four bags, 32 additions of the totals of eight bags, 16 additions of the totals of sixteen bags, 8 additions of the totals of thirty-two bags, 4 additions of the totals of sixty-four bags, 2 additions of the totals of one hundred twenty eight bags, and 1 final addition that would be the total of all the bags.  
This would be a total of 128+64+32+16+8+4+2+1 = 255 additions, which is the same number as if they had simply added the bags one by one and kept a running total.  
It would take one cashier 255 seconds to sum the bags.  


Problem 2
Second 1: Each of the eight cashiers totals a pair of bags, leaving 8 sums and 240 unsummed bags.  
Second 2: Each of the eight cashiers totals a pair of bags, leaving 16 sums and 224 unsummed bags.  
Second 3: Each of the eight cashiers totals a pair of bags, leaving 24 sums and 208 unsummed bags.  
...
Second 16: Each of the eight cashiers totals a pair of bags, leaving 128 sums and 0 unsummed bags.  
Second 17: Each of the eight cashiers totals a pair of sums, leaving 120 sums.
Second 18: Each of the eight cashiers totals a pair of sums, leaving 112 sums.
...
Second 30: Each of the eight cashiers totals a pair of sums, leaving 16 sums. 
Second 31: Each of the eight cashiers totals a pair of sums, leaving 8 sums.  
Second 32: Four of the cashiers total a pair of sums, leaving 4 sums.  
Second 33: Two of the cashiers total a pair of sums, leaving 2 sums.  
Second 34: One of the cashiers totals the last pair of sums.  
It would take 34 seconds for the eight cashiers to sum the bags.  


Problem 3
Second 1: Each of 128 employees total a pair of bags, leaving 128 sums.  
Second 2: 64 employees each total a pair of sums, leaving 64 sums.  
Second 3: 32 employees each total a pair of sums, leaving 32 sums. 
...
Second 7: 2 employees each total a pair of sums, leaving 2 sums.  
Second 8: 1 employee totals the final pair of sums.  
It would take an infinite number of employees 8 seconds to sum the bags.  


Problem 4
Looking at the number of seconds that it would take an infinite number of employees to sum N bags (looking at the range from N = 2 to N = 17, I see a pattern that the amount of time is equal to:
log_base_2(N) rounded up to the nearest whole number.
