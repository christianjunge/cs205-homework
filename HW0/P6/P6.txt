6.  Running the code several times, I see that in the first iteration, the first four Hi statements come out in order.  Then each process waits for a quarter second, and then puts out a Bye statement and the Hi statement for the subsequent job.  The Hi statements all come out in order, however the Bye statements often come out not in order.  What is happening is that the processes are happening at almost the exact same instant, so they do not synchronize.  As soon as one process puts out its Bye statement, it instantly snaps up the next available Hi statement, so the Hi statements stay in order, but the Bye statements are all trying to come out at once, and the order gets messed up.  

For example:

Hi Job 0
Hi Job 1
Hi Job 2
Hi Job 3    # The first four Hi statements always come out in order
---------At this point, all four processes are sleeping for 0.25 seconds
Bye Job 1   # The first bye statment came out out of order because it was working simultaneously
Hi Job 4    #     with the other three.  This process then snatched up Hi 4, which was the next one.  
Bye Job 0
Hi Job 5    # The subsequent Hi statements (4,5,6,7) always come out in order
Bye Job 2
Hi Job 6
Bye Job 3  # Bye 0, 1, 2, and 3 always come out in this step, but not always in order
Hi Job 7
---------All four processes are sleeping at the same time again
Bye Job 5
Hi Job 8   # The four processes each execute a Bye, and the first two snatch up the last 2 Hi's
Bye Job 6
Hi Job 9
Bye Job 7  
Bye Job 4
---------The first two processes to execute sleep again before executing the last 2 Byes
Bye Job 9
Bye Job 8
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]


This could require us to burn time to synchronize the outputs to make sure that the outputs all come out in order.  

For example, if we were processing time-series data, it would be important for all of the outputs to come out in order.
